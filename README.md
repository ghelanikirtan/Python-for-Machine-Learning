# Python-for-Machine-Learning
<p> I'm making notes of python for machine learning for myself, but it may be helpful for others so keeping it public. 😜 </p>

- I am using Jupyter Notebook 📒 here, because it is more convinent and provides better environment to work with machine learning and data science.
- 📂 All files will be in ***.ipynb*** format so use Jupyter lab/notebook (A part of anaconda) to avail my code. 😁
- 🐍 You can download ANACONDA *(uses python 3.9)* from [**here**](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). 
- Here is the guide to Jupyter Notebook : [GUIDE 📖](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/). 🤘
